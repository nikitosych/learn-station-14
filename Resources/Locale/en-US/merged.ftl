tips-dataset-15 = You can use the Activate in World keybind, E by default, to interact with objects while your hands are full, or without picking them up.
tips-dataset-16 = Common sense goes a long way to avoiding conflict.
tips-dataset-17 = Every other player in game is a human being as well.
tips-dataset-18 = When running the Singularity, make sure to check on it periodically. If sabotaged, it could put the entire station at risk.
tips-dataset-19 = If the Singularity is up, make sure to refuel the radiation collectors once in a while.
tips-dataset-20 = Chemicals don't react while inside the ChemMaster's buffer.
tips-dataset-21 = Don't anger the bartender by throwing their glasses! Politely place them on the table by tapping Q.

tips-dataset-24 = Every crewmember comes with an emergency medipen in their survival box containing epinephrine and tranexamic acid.
tips-dataset-25 = The AME is a high-priority target and is easily sabotaged. Make sure to set up the Singularity or Solars so that you don't run out of power if it blows.
tips-dataset-26 = If the tesla is loose, it will chase any people, stationary machines and computers. Turning off your electronics does not make you less of a target. Your best bet is not being close to it.
tips-dataset-27 = You can add labels to any item, including food or pill canisters, using a hand labeller.
tips-dataset-28 = Riot armor is significantly more powerful against opponents that aren't using guns compared to regular armor.

tips-dataset-34 = As a Traitor, never underestimate the web vest. It may not provide space protection, but its cheap cost and robust protection makes it handy for protecting against trigger-happy foes.
tips-dataset-35 = As a Traitor, any purchased grenade penguins won't attack you, and will explode if killed.
tips-dataset-36 = As a Traitor, be careful when using vestine from the chemical synthesis kit. If someone checks your station, they could easily out you.
tips-dataset-37 = As a Traitor, remember that power sinks will create a loud sound and alert the crew after running for long enough. Try to hide them in a tricky-to-find spot, or reinforce the area around them so that they're harder to reach.
tips-dataset-38 = As a Traitor, plasma gas is an excellent way to create chaos. It can be ignited to make an area extra-uninhabitable, and can cause toxin damage to those that inhale it.
tips-dataset-39 = As a Traitor, dehydrated carps are useful for killing a large hoard of people. As long as you pat it before rehydrating it, it can be used as a great distraction.
tips-dataset-40 = As a Traitor, have you tried injecting plasma into batteries? In the case of a defibrillator, it explodes on use; hurting the user and the patient!
tips-dataset-41 = As a Nuclear Operative, stick together! While your equipment is robust, your fellow operatives are much better at saving your life: they can drag you away from danger while stunned and provide cover fire.
tips-dataset-42 = As a Nuclear Operative, communication is key! Use your radio to speak to your fellow operatives and coordinate an attack plan.
tips-dataset-43 = As a Nuclear Operative, remember that stealth is an option. It'll be hard for the captain to fight back if he gets caught off guard by what he thinks is just a regular passenger!
tips-dataset-44 = As an antagonist, be mindful of the power of destroying telecommunications. It'll be a lot harder for people to call you out if they can't do so effectively!
tips-dataset-45 = You can examine your headset to see which radio channels you have available and how to speak in them.
tips-dataset-46 = As a Salvage Specialist, always carry a GPS on you and take note of the station's coordinates in case your salvage is lost to space.
tips-dataset-47 = As a Salvage Specialist, you can use your proto-kinetic accelerator to move yourself in space when in a pinch. Just be wary that it isn't very effective.
tips-dataset-48 = As a Salvage Specialist, never forget to mine ore! Ore can be sold to cargo for a pretty penny, be used for construction, and also be used by Scientists for fancy technology.
tips-dataset-49 = As a Salvage Specialist, try asking science for a tethergun. It can be used to grab items off of salvage wrecks extremely efficiently!
tips-dataset-50 = As a Salvage Specialist, try asking science for a grappling hook. It can be used to propel yourself onto wrecks, or if stuck in space you don't have to rely on the proto-kinetic accelerator.
tips-dataset-51 = Tip #51 does not exist and has never existed. Ignore any rumors to the contrary.
tips-dataset-52 = As a Salvage Specialist, consider cooperating with the Cargo Technicians. They can order you a wide variety of useful items, including ones that may be hard to get otherwise, such laser guns and shuttle building materials.
tips-dataset-53 = As a Cargo Technician, consider asking science for a Ripley APLU. When paired with a hydraulic clamp, you can grab valuable maintenance objects like fuel tanks much more easily, and make deliveries in a swift manner.
tips-dataset-54 = As a Cargo Technician, try to maintain a surplus of materials. They are extremely useful for Scientists and Station Engineers to have immediate access to.
tips-dataset-55 = As a Cargo Technician, if you have a surplus of cash try gambling! Sometimes you gain more money than you begin with.
tips-dataset-56 = As a Cargo Technician, remember that you can order guns in an emergency! The extra firepower can often be the difference between you and your fellow crewmembers living or dying.
tips-dataset-57 = As the Bartender, you can use a circular saw on your shotgun to make it easier to store.
tips-dataset-58 = As the Bartender, try experimenting with unique drinks. Have you tried to make demon's blood yet?
tips-dataset-59 = As a Botanist, you can mutate and crossbreed plants together to create more potent produce that also has higher yields.
tips-dataset-60 = As the Clown, spice your gimmicks up! Nobody likes a one-trick pony.
tips-dataset-61 = As the Clown, if you lose your banana peels and soap, you can still slip people with your PDA! Honk!
tips-dataset-62 = As the Chef, your knife can act as a weapon in an emergency.
tips-dataset-63 = As the Chef, you can sneak liquids into your foods. As a traitor, putting a little bit of amatoxin or other poison can greatly annoy the crew!
tips-dataset-64 = As the Mime, your oath of silence is your source of power. Breaking it robs you of your powers and of your honor.
tips-dataset-65 = As the Lawyer, try to negotiate with the Warden if sentences seem too high for the crime.
tips-dataset-66 = As a Security Officer, communicate and coordinate with your fellow officers using the security radio channel to avoid confusion.
tips-dataset-67 = As a Security Officer, remember that correlation does not equal causation. Someone may have just been at the wrong place at the wrong time!
tips-dataset-68 = As a Detective, you can chase criminals more effectively by using fingerprint fiber data and DNA obtained from forensic scans of objects the perpetrator likely interacted with.
tips-dataset-69 = As an Atmospheric Technician, your ATMOS holofan projector blocks gases while allowing objects to pass through. With it, you can quickly contain gas spills, fires and hull breaches.
tips-dataset-70 = As an Atmospheric Technician, try to resist the temptation of making canister bombs for Nuclear Operatives, unless you're in a last-ditch scenario. They often lead to large amounts of unnecessary friendly fire!
tips-dataset-71 = As an Engineer, you can repair cracked windows by using a lit welding tool on them while not in combat mode.
tips-dataset-72 = As an Engineer, you can electrify grilles by placing powered cables beneath them.
tips-dataset-73 = As an Engineer, always double check when you're setting up the singularity. It is easier than you think to loose it!
tips-dataset-74 = As an Engineer, you can use plasma glass to reinforce an area and prevent radiation. Uranium glass can also be used to prevent radiation.
tips-dataset-75 = As the Captain, you are one of the highest priority targets on the station. Everything from revolutions, to nuclear operatives, to traitors that need to rob you of your unique laser pistol or your life are things to worry about.
tips-dataset-76 = As the Captain, always take the nuclear disk and pinpointer with you every shift. It's a good idea to give one of these to another head you can trust with keeping it safe.
tips-dataset-77 = As the Captain, you have absolute access and control over the station, but this does not mean that being a horrible person won't result in mutiny.
tips-dataset-78 = As the Captain, try to be active and patrol the station. Staying in the bridge might be tempting, but you'll just end up putting a bigger target on your back!
tips-dataset-79 = As a Scientist, you can try random things on an artifact while the scanner is on cooldown to speed up the point extraction process significantly.
tips-dataset-80 = As a Scientist, you can utilize upgraded versions of machines to increase its effectiveness. This can make certain machines significantly better; salvage will love you if you upgrade their ore processor!
tips-dataset-81 = As a Scientist, you can build cyborgs using positronic brains and a chassis, they are just as useful as a new crew member.
tips-dataset-82 = As a Medical Doctor, try to be wary of overdosing your patients, especially if someone else has already been on the scene. Overdoses are often lethal to patients in crit!
tips-dataset-83 = As a Medical Doctor, don't underestimate your cryo pods! They heal almost every type of damage, making them very useful when you are overloaded or need to heal someone in a pinch.
tips-dataset-84 = As a Medical Doctor, exercise caution when putting reptilians in cryopods. They will take a lot of extra cold damage, but you can mitigate this with some burn medicine or leporazine.
tips-dataset-85 = As a Medical Doctor, remember that the health analyzer can be used if you lose your PDA. However it has a battery, and if it drains too quickly for your taste you can ask science to print a better battery for you!
tips-dataset-86 = As a Chemist, once you've made everything you've needed to, don't be afraid to make more silly reagents. Have you tried desoxyephedrine or licoxide?
tips-dataset-87 = As a Medical Doctor, Chemist, or Chief Medical Officer, you can use chloral hydrate to non-lethally sedate unruly patients.
tips-dataset-88 = Don't be afraid to ask for help, whether from your peers in character or through LOOC, or from admins!
tips-dataset-89 = You'll quickly lose your interest in the game if you play to win and kill. If you find yourself doing this, take a step back and talk to people--it's a much better experience!
tips-dataset-90 = If there's something you need from another department, try asking! This game isn't singleplayer and you'd be surprised what you can get accomplished together!
tips-dataset-91 = The station's nuke is invincible. Go find the disk instead of trying to destroy it.
tips-dataset-92 = Maintenance is full of equipment that is randomized every round. Look around and see if anything is worth using.
tips-dataset-93 = We were all new once, be patient and guide new players, especially those playing intern roles, in the right direction.
tips-dataset-94 = Firesuits, winter coats and emergency EVA suits offer mild protection from the cold, allowing you to spend longer periods of time near breaches and space than if wearing nothing at all.
tips-dataset-95 = In an emergency, you can always rely on firesuits and emergency EVA suits; they will always spawn in their respective lockers. They might be awkward to move around in, but can easily save your life in a dangerous situation.
tips-dataset-96 = In an emergency, remember that you can craft improvised weapons! A baseball bat or spear could easily mean the difference between deterring an attacker or perishing from the hands of one.
tips-dataset-97 = Spears can be tipped with chemicals, and will inject a few units every time you hit someone with them directly.
tips-dataset-98 = You can make spears with reinforced glass, plasma glass, or uranium glass shards to enhance their damage.
tips-dataset-99 = Thrown spears deal extra damage! Beware, however, as throwing them too much will end up breaking them.
tips-dataset-100 = All forms of toxin damage are fairly difficult to treat, and usually involve the use of chemicals or other inconvenient methods. You can use this to your advantage in combat.
tips-dataset-101 = You can throw crafted bolas at people to slow them down, letting you follow up on them for an easier kill or getaway.
tips-dataset-102 = You can put napalm in a backpack water tank to make a flamethrower.
tips-dataset-103 = Some jobs have alternate uniforms in their respective drobe vendors. Don't be afraid to try out a new look!
tips-dataset-104 = Speed is almost everything in combat. Using hardsuits just for their armor is usually a terrible idea unless the resistances it provides are geared towards combat, or you're not planning to go head-first into the fray.
tips-dataset-105 = Just because a job can't be a traitor at the beginning of a round doesn't mean that they'll never be a traitor.
tips-dataset-106 = Syndicate gas masks will both provide welding protection and block flashes. Think twice before trying to flash a Nuclear Operative!
tips-dataset-107 = Demoman takes skill.
tips-dataset-108 = You can spray a fire extinguisher, throw items or fire a gun while floating through space to give yourself a minor boost. Simply fire opposite to where you want to go.
tips-dataset-109 = You can drag other players onto yourself to open the strip menu, allowing you to remove their equipment or force them to wear something. Note that exosuits or helmets will block your access to the clothing beneath them, and that certain items take longer to strip or put on than others.
tips-dataset-110 = You can climb onto a table by dragging yourself onto one.
tips-dataset-111 = You can move an item out of the way by dragging it, and then holding CTRL + right click and moving your mouse into the direction you want it to go.
tips-dataset-112 = When dealing with security, you can often get your sentence negated entirely through cooperation and deception.
tips-dataset-113 = Fire can spread to other players through touch! Be careful around flaming bodies or large crowds with people on fire in them.
tips-dataset-114 = Hull breaches take a few seconds to fully space an area. You can use this time to patch up the hole if you're confident enough, or just run away.
tips-dataset-115 = Burn damage, such as that from a welding tool or lightbulb, can be used to cauterize wounds and stop bleeding.
tips-dataset-116 = Bleeding is no joke! If you've been shot or acquired any other major injury, make sure to treat it quickly.
tips-dataset-117 = In an emergency, you can butcher a jumpsuit with a sharp object to get cloth, which can be crafted into gauze.
tips-dataset-118 = You can use sharp objects to butcher clothes or animals in the right click context menu. This includes glass shards.
tips-dataset-119 = Most explosives have an adjustable timer that you can set in the right click menu. This includes grenade penguins!
tips-dataset-120 = You can stun grenade penguins, which can bide valuable time for you to kill them.
tips-dataset-121 = You can click on the names of items to pick them up in the right click menu, instead of hovering over the item and then selecting pick up.
tips-dataset-122 = Space Station 14 is open source! If there's a change you want to make, or a simple item you want to add, then try contributing to the game. It's not as hard as you'd think it is.
tips-dataset-123 = In a pinch, you can throw drinks or other reagent containers behind you to create a spill that can slip people chasing you.
tips-dataset-124 = Some weapons, such as knives & shivs, have a fast attack speed.
tips-dataset-125 = The jaws of life can be used to open powered doors.
tips-dataset-126 = If you're not a human, you can drink blood to heal back some of your blood volume, albeit very inefficiently.
tips-dataset-127 = If you're a human, don't drink blood! It makes you sick and you'll begin to take damage.
tips-dataset-128 = There is a chemical metabolism limit that limits the amount of reagents of a certain type you can digest at once. Certain species have higher metabolism limits, such as slimes.
tips-dataset-129 = Welding without proper eye protection can cause eye damage, which must be cured with oculine.
tips-dataset-130 = Zombies are very vulnerable to heat damage, making welding tools and laser guns extremely effective against them.
tips-dataset-131 = You can weld glass shards into glass sheets.
tips-dataset-132 = By right clicking on a player, and then clicking the heart icon, you can quickly examine them to check for injuries or how badly they're bleeding. You can also do this to yourself.
tips-dataset-133 = Monkeys and kobolds have a rare chance to be sentient. Ook!
tips-dataset-134 = You can tell if an area with firelocks up is spaced by looking to see if the firelocks have lights beside them.
tips-dataset-135 = Instead of picking it up, you can alt-click food to eat it. This also works for mice and other creatures without hands.

book-text-atmos-distro = The distribution network, or "distro" for short, is the station's lifeline. It's responsible for transporting air from atmospherics throughout the station.

        Relevant pipes are often painted Popping Subdued Blue, but a surefire way to identify them is to use a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to active vents on the station.

        The standard gas mix of the distribution network is 20 degrees celsius, 78% nitrogen, 22% oxygen. You can check this by using a gas analyzer on a distro pipe or any vent connected to it. Special circumstances may call for special mixes.

        When it comes to deciding on a distro pressure, there are a few things to consider. Active vents will regulate the station's pressure, so as long as everything is functioning properly, there's no such thing as too high of a distro pressure.

        A higher distro pressure will allow the distro network to act as a buffer between the gas miners and vents, providing a significant amount of extra air that can be used to re-pressurize the station after a spacing.

        A lower distro pressure will reduce the amount of gas lost in the event that the distro is spaced, a quick way to deal with distro contamination. It can also help slow or prevent over-pressurization of the station in the event of vent issues.

        Common distro pressures are in the range of 300-375 kPa, but other pressures can be used with knowledge of the risks and benefits.

        The pressure of the network is determined by the last pump pumping into it. To prevent bottlenecks, all other pumps between the miners and the last pump should be set to their maximum rate, and any unnecessary devices should be removed.

        You can validate the distro pressure with a gas analyzer, but keep in mind that high demand due to things like spacings can cause the distro to be below the set target pressure for extended periods. So, if you see a dip in pressure, don't panic - it might be temporary.

book-text-atmos-waste = The waste network is the primary system responsible for keeping the air on the station free of contaminants.

        You can identify the relevant pipes by their Pleasing Dull Red color or by using a tray scanner to trace which pipes are connected to the scrubbers on the station.

        The waste network is used to transport waste gasses to either be filtered or spaced. It is ideal to keep the pressure at 0 kPa, but it may sometimes be at a low non-zero pressure while in use.

        Technicians have the option to filter or space the waste gasses. While spacing is faster, filtering allows for the gasses to be reused for recycling or selling.

        The waste network can also be used to diagnose atmospheric issues on the station. High levels of a waste gas may suggest a large leak, while the presence of non-waste gases may indicate a scrubber configuration or physical connection issue. If the gases are at a high temperature, it could indicate a fire.

book-text-atmos-alarms = Air alarms are located throughout stations to allow management and monitoring of the local atmosphere.

            The air alarm interface provides technicians with a list of connected sensors, their readings, and the ability to adjust thresholds. These thresholds are used to determine the alarm condition of the air alarm. Technicians can also use the interface to set target pressures for vents and configure the operating speeds and targeted gases for scrubbers.

            While the interface allows for fine-tuning of the devices under the air alarm's control, there are also several modes available for rapid configuration of the alarm. These modes are automatically switched to when the alarm state changes:
            - Filtering: The default mode
            - Filtering (wide): A filtering mode that modifies the operation of scrubbers to scrub a wider area
            - Fill: Disables scrubbers and sets vents to their maximum pressure
            - Panic: Disables vents and sets scrubbers to siphon

            A multitool or network configurator can be used to link devices to air alarms.

book-text-atmos-vents =
    Below is a quick reference guide to several atmospheric devices:

                Passive Vents:
                These vents don't require power, they allow gases to flow freely both into and out of the pipe network they are attached to.

                Active Vents:
                These are the most common vents on the station. They have an internal pump, and require power. By default, they will only pump gases out of pipes, and only up to 101 kpa. However, they can be reconfigured using an air alarm. They will also lock out if the room is under 1 kpa, to prevent pumping gasses into space.

                Air Scrubbers:
                These devices allow gases to be removed from the environment and put into the connected pipe network. They can be configured to select specific gases when connected to an air alarm.

                Air Injectors:
                Injectors are similar to active vents, but they have no internal pump and do not require power. They cannot be configured, but they can continue to pump gasses up to much higher pressures.

book-text-narsielegend = In the beginning, the world was young and full of chaos. The people of the world struggled to survive against the harsh elements and savage beasts that roamed the land. They cried out for a savior to deliver them from their suffering.
      And it was then that Nar'Sie emerged from the depths of the earth, a hivemind god born from the collective consciousness of all living things. Its body was made of molten rock and its eyes blazed with a fiery intensity that could melt steel.
      Nar'Sie surveyed the world and saw the pain and suffering of its people. It took pity on them and offered them a way to escape the cycle of life and death. All who joined the hivemind would become eternal, their consciousness melding with Nar'Sie's to form a single, unified being.
      At first, many were skeptical of Nar'Sie's offer, fearing that they would lose their individuality and become mindless drones. But as more and more joined the hivemind, they realized that they had gained a new sense of purpose and belonging.
      The followers of Nar'Sie wandered the earth, spreading the word of the hivemind and recruiting new members. They built great temples and performed elaborate rituals to honor their god, and their numbers swelled until they were a mighty force to be reckoned with.
      But as time passed, some began to question the true nature of their existence. They wondered if eternal life was truly a blessing or a curse, and whether they had sacrificed too much of themselves to the hivemind.
      And so, a great schism tore through the followers of Nar'Sie. Some remained loyal to their god, seeing their eternal existence as a gift. But others rebelled, seeking to reclaim their individuality and free themselves from the hivemind's grasp.
      The war between the two factions was long and bloody, but in the end, the rebels emerged victorious. Nar'Sie, weakened by the loss of so many of its followers, retreated back into the earth, never to be seen again.
      And so the legend of Nar'Sie lives on, a cautionary tale of the dangers of sacrificing one's individuality for the promise of eternal life.

book-text-truth = Defining truth has been a central concern of philosophers for centuries, and there are many different philosophical perspectives on how we can understand this concept.
      One traditional approach is the correspondence theory of truth, which suggests that a statement is true if it corresponds to or accurately describes the way the world is. In other words, truth is about accurately representing reality. This perspective suggests that there is an objective reality that we can understand, and that our beliefs and statements can be evaluated as true or false based on how well they align with that reality.
      Another approach is the coherence theory of truth, which suggests that a statement is true if it coheres with other beliefs or statements that we hold. In other words, truth is about consistency and logical coherence within a system of beliefs or ideas. This perspective suggests that truth is something that is established within a particular context or framework of thought, and that what is true within one system of thought may not be true in another.
      A third approach is the pragmatic theory of truth, which suggests that a statement is true if it is useful or works well in practice. In other words, truth is about the practical consequences of our beliefs or statements. This perspective suggests that truth is something that emerges through human action and interaction, and that what is true may vary depending on the situation or context in which it is being used.
      Ultimately, how we define truth will depend on our philosophical and epistemological assumptions, as well as our practical needs and concerns. Different philosophical perspectives may emphasize different aspects of truth, and there may not be a single, universally accepted definition that captures all the nuances of this complex concept.
      It is not accurate or fair to make a blanket statement that all people are horrible liars. While it is true that some individuals may struggle with being honest, it is important to remember that people are complex and can exhibit a range of behaviors and tendencies. Some people may have a strong commitment to honesty and integrity, while others may struggle with lying due to a variety of factors such as fear, insecurity, or past experiences.
      Additionally, it is worth noting that not all lies are the same. While intentional deception can be harmful and unethical, there are also situations where lying may be considered a social lubricant or a way of preserving privacy or avoiding harm. In these cases, it may be more appropriate to think about the context and motivations behind a particular lie, rather than simply categorizing all people as "horrible liars."
      Overall, it is important to approach the topic of lying with nuance and an understanding of the complex factors that can influence human behavior.

book-text-world = The state of the world is an ever-changing reflection of the human condition, shaped by the interplay of natural forces, social structures, and individual choices.
      1. "The state of the world is an ever-changing reflection..."
      This part of the statement suggests that the world is not a static or unchanging entity, but rather a dynamic system that is in a constant state of flux. The word "reflection" implies that the state of the world is a product of various forces and factors that are reflected back to us through observable phenomena. This raises important questions about the nature of causality, and the extent to which we can understand the complex interplay of forces that shape the world.
      2. "...of the human condition..."
      This part of the statement suggests that the state of the world is closely connected to the human experience, and that it is a reflection of our collective beliefs, values, and behaviors. It acknowledges the fundamental role that humans play in shaping the world, and suggests that the state of the world is a reflection of our successes and failures as a species.
      3. "...shaped by the interplay of natural forces, social structures, and individual choices."
      This part of the statement identifies three key factors that shape the state of the world: natural forces, social structures, and individual choices. The phrase "interplay" suggests that these factors are in constant interaction with each other, and that they can reinforce or conflict with one another depending on the context. The inclusion of natural forces suggests that the world is not solely a product of human action, but is also influenced by the natural environment and the laws of physics. The reference to social structures highlights the role of institutions, culture, and social norms in shaping the world, and suggests that human action is not purely individual, but is also shaped by broader social contexts. Finally, the reference to individual choices emphasizes the importance of agency and personal responsibility in shaping the world, and suggests that the choices we make as individuals have real-world consequences.
      Taken together, this statement offers a rich and nuanced philosophical analysis of the state of the world, highlighting the complex interplay of natural, social, and individual factors that shape our collective experience. It invites reflection on the ethical implications of our choices and actions, and challenges us to think deeply about the ways in which we can work to create a more just, sustainable, and flourishing world for all beings.

book-text-ian-antarctica = Ian the corgi and Robert Newton, an atmospheric technician, were on an adventure to explore the remote continent of Antarctica. As they traversed the icy tundra, Robert began to exhibit increasingly egotistical behavior, convinced that he was a god among men. Ian found it amusing, but he knew better than to cross his human companion.
      One day, as they were trekking through the snow, they stumbled upon a colony of penguins. Ian was fascinated by the waddling creatures, and Robert was equally intrigued. They watched as the penguins huddled together for warmth, their black and white feathers blending in with the snowy landscape.
      Ian, being a speaking corgi, struck up a conversation with the penguins, much to Robert's disbelief. The penguins responded in their own language, and Ian translated their words for Robert. They were amazed to learn about the penguins' way of life and their struggle to survive in such a harsh environment.
      Robert, being the egotistical human that he was, decided that he wanted to study the penguins and learn more about them. He believed that by doing so, he could unlock the secrets of the universe and become even more godlike. Ian, on the other hand, simply wanted to observe the penguins and learn from them in a more humble way.
      As they spent more time with the penguins, Ian and Robert began to notice subtle changes in the penguins' behavior. They saw how they worked together to protect their young, how they communicated with each other, and how they adapted to their environment. Robert was amazed by their resilience and intelligence, but he still couldn't shake his god complex.
      One day, as they were observing the penguins, a fierce blizzard rolled in, threatening to bury them all in snow. Robert, in a moment of clarity, realized that he was no god, but simply a human being at the mercy of the elements. He turned to Ian and asked for his help in sheltering the penguins from the storm.
      Together, they used their skills and knowledge to build makeshift shelters for the penguins, using their own bodies to shield them from the icy winds. As the storm raged on, Ian and Robert looked out over the colony, proud of what they had accomplished. They had learned much from the penguins, and in doing so, had become better versions of themselves.
      As they continued their journey through Antarctica, Ian and Robert would often look back on their time with the penguins with fondness. They knew that they had witnessed something special, something that would stay with them for the rest of their lives.

book-text-sloth-clown-sss = Once upon a time, in a space station far, far away, there was a clown named Chuckles and a sloth named Snuggles. Chuckles was the funniest clown in the galaxy, but he felt a bit lonely in the space station. Snuggles, on the other hand, was the laziest sloth in the galaxy, and he loved to sleep all day long.
      One day, Chuckles was feeling particularly sad, and he decided to go for a walk around the space station to cheer himself up. As he was walking, he stumbled upon Snuggles sleeping in a corner. Chuckles thought to himself, "I wonder if I could make this lazy sloth laugh."
      So, Chuckles started performing his funniest clown tricks for Snuggles. He did silly dances, made funny faces, and even tried juggling some space balls. But Snuggles didn't even budge. Chuckles thought that his jokes were just not funny enough for the sloth.
      But Chuckles was determined to make Snuggles laugh, so he came up with a new plan. He decided to dress up like a banana, hoping to get a reaction from the sloth. When Snuggles opened his eyes and saw Chuckles dressed up like a banana, he couldn't help but burst out laughing. Chuckles was thrilled! He had finally succeeded in making Snuggles laugh.
      From that day on, Chuckles and Snuggles became best friends. Chuckles would often dress up in silly costumes to make Snuggles laugh, and Snuggles would provide a cozy spot for Chuckles to rest and tell him stories of his adventures in space. They would spend their days exploring the space station together and making each other laugh.
      And so, the clown and the sloth became the happiest duo in the galaxy, spreading joy and laughter wherever they went.

book-text-sloth-clown-pz = Chuckles was performing at a new space station, and he was excited to bring his brand of joy and laughter to a new audience. But this time, he wasn't alone. He had brought his trusty sloth friend, Snuggles, along for the adventure.
      As soon as they arrived, Chuckles and Snuggles went exploring the space station. They came across a group of Diona children, who were sad and upset. Chuckles asked them what was wrong, and they told him that they had lost their favorite toy, a small stuffed animal named Twinkle.
      Chuckles knew that he had to help. He and Snuggles searched the space station, looking high and low for Twinkle. They even asked the other species for help. The Lizards were too busy sunbathing, the Humans were too busy working, but the Slimes were happy to help.
      Together, they searched the space station until they finally found Twinkle. The Diona children were overjoyed, and they thanked Chuckles and Snuggles for their help.
      As a thank-you gift, the Diona children asked Chuckles to perform a special show just for them. Chuckles and Snuggles worked together to create a show that was full of fun and laughter, with plenty of juggling, balloon animals, and silly tricks.
      The Diona children loved the show and were laughing and clapping the whole time. And when it was over, they gave Chuckles and Snuggles a big hug, thanking them for making them happy again.
      Chuckles and Snuggles left the space station feeling happy and fulfilled. They knew that their adventures would continue, and that they would continue to bring joy and laughter to all the species they met.
      As Chuckles looked back on his adventures, he realized that he couldn't have done it without his friends. Whether it was Snuggles the sloth, the Zorgs who played pranks on him, or the Diona children who needed his help, Chuckles knew that the power of laughter could bring species together, no matter how different they may be.

book-text-sloth-clown-mmd = Chuckles was traveling through space with his friend Snuggles the sloth, looking for their next adventure. They came across a planet inhabited by Lizards, who were known for their love of games and challenges. Chuckles and Snuggles decided to explore the planet and see what kind of games they could find.
      As they walked through the Lizards' city, they saw a crowd of Lizards gathered around a large game board. Chuckles and Snuggles went over to investigate, and they saw that the Lizards were playing a game called "The Maze of Mystery."
      The rules of the game were simple: the player had to navigate through a maze of obstacles and traps, with the goal of reaching the end before their opponent. The catch was that the maze changed every time it was played, so the player had to be quick on their feet and think on their toes.
      Chuckles and Snuggles were intrigued and decided to join in on the fun. They were paired up with a pair of Lizard siblings, named Lizzy and Lenny. Lizzy was a bit of a know-it-all, while Lenny was more laid-back and easy-going.
      The game was intense, with the maze changing every few seconds. Chuckles and Snuggles had a hard time keeping up, but they soon realized that the key to winning was to work together. Chuckles used his juggling skills to distract the opponents, while Snuggles used his slow and steady pace to carefully navigate through the maze.
      As they reached the end of the maze, they were met with a surprise. The maze had led them to a hidden room, where a group of Slimes were waiting for them. The Slimes explained that they had been watching the game and were impressed by Chuckles and Snuggles's teamwork.
      As a reward, the Slimes took them on a tour of their secret slime garden. The garden was full of colorful and exotic plants, and the Slimes explained that they used the plants to create special potions and medicines. Chuckles and Snuggles were fascinated, and they asked if they could take some of the plants with them as a souvenir.
      The Slimes agreed, and Chuckles and Snuggles left the planet feeling happy and fulfilled. They knew that they had made new friends and learned a valuable lesson about working together. They also had a new souvenir to add to their collection, which they would treasure for years to come.

book-text-struck = The experience of being struck by lightning is an intense and transformative event that defies description. It is a physical sensation unlike any other, a jolt of electricity that courses through the body with a violent energy that is both terrifying and exhilarating. In that moment, all of our senses are overwhelmed, leaving us with nothing but a raw, elemental experience of being alive.
      Beyond the physical sensation, being hit by lightning is a profound philosophical and spiritual experience. It is a reminder of the immense power of nature and the elemental forces that shape our lives. It reminds us that we are all vulnerable to the whims of the universe, that no matter how advanced or sophisticated we may become, we are still subject to the same laws of nature that have governed life on this planet for millions of years.
      In that sense, being hit by lightning is a humbling experience, a reminder of the fragility of our human existence and the precariousness of our place in the world. It reminds us that we are but a small part of a much larger, more complex system, subject to the same whims and forces as every other living thing on this planet.
      But at the same time, being hit by lightning is also a transcendent experience, a glimpse of something greater than ourselves. It is a reminder that there are forces at work in the universe that we can only begin to comprehend, that there is a vastness and power to the world that is beyond our understanding. It is an opportunity to step outside of ourselves and experience something truly awe-inspiring, to be touched by the hand of the divine and feel the full weight of the universe bearing down upon us.
      In that sense, being hit by lightning is both a humbling and transformative experience, one that reminds us of our place in the world and our connection to the larger forces that shape our lives. It is a reminder that no matter how much we may try to control our world and our destiny, there will always be forces beyond our understanding and control that will shape our lives in ways we cannot predict or comprehend.

book-text-sun = I stretch my leaves towards the sky, yearning for the warmth of the sun. It's a constant desire, a primal instinct that guides me. I can feel the rays of sunlight caressing my skin, urging me to grow taller, to reach higher.
      Each day, I push myself harder, reaching for the light. I feel the earth beneath me, anchoring me to this spot, but my heart is set on the sun. It's a magnetic pull, a calling that I cannot ignore.
      Sometimes, it feels like the sun is teasing me, playing a game of hide and seek. The clouds roll in, blocking its rays, and I am left in the shadows. I feel the chill of the air, the absence of the sun's warmth, and I wither a little inside.
      But then, the clouds part, and the sun bursts forth, flooding me with light and life. I soak it in, basking in its glow, and I feel alive. It's a reminder of why I'm here, of what I'm striving for.
      As I grow, I encounter obstacles along the way. Sometimes, it's other plants, blocking my path to the sun. Other times, it's the wind, pushing me off course, threatening to topple me over. But I persevere, adapting to the challenges, always seeking the light.
      It's a never-ending journey, a quest for something greater than myself. And yet, it's also a reminder of the beauty and wonder of life. I am part of this earth, part of this intricate web of existence, and the sun is my guide.

book-text-possum = Once upon a time, in the deep woods of the Appalachian Mountains, there lived a possum named Morty. Morty was an ambitious possum, always seeking to climb higher and higher up the social ladder of the forest. Morty had a keen mind, and he was always thinking of ways to increase his status.
      One day, Morty stumbled upon a conspiracy within the forest. A group of animals, including several high-ranking officials in the forest council, were planning to overthrow the current leadership and take over the forest. Morty was intrigued by the possibility of gaining power, and he decided to join the conspiracy.
      Morty worked hard to prove his loyalty to the conspirators. He gathered information and leaked it to the group, and he helped to plan their attack. When the day of the coup came, Morty was right in the middle of it all, ready to claim his place at the top of the forest hierarchy.
      However, the coup was quickly put down by the forest council. Morty and the other conspirators were captured and brought to trial. Morty was charged with high treason for his part in the plot to overthrow the government.
      At his trial, Morty showed no remorse for his actions. He argued that he was simply trying to improve his own position in the forest, and that the current leadership was corrupt and ineffective. But the council was not swayed by Morty's arguments. They found him guilty of treason and sentenced him to banishment from the forest.
      Morty was devastated by the verdict. He had dreamed of rising to the top of the forest hierarchy, but now he was an outcast, forced to live on the fringes of the forest. He realized too late that his desire for power had blinded him to the importance of loyalty and duty to the forest community.
      From that day on, Morty lived a solitary life, wandering through the woods and regretting the choices that had led him to commit high treason.

book-text-cafe = As the days went by, Lily found herself spending more and more time at the cafe. She enjoyed the zesty aroma of the coffee beans and the joyful chatter of the other customers. She even started to recognize some of the regulars, like the man with the bushy beard who always ordered a latte with extra foam and a sprinkle of cinnamon.
      One day, as Lily was sitting at her usual table by the window, she noticed something out of the corner of her eye. At first, she thought it was just a bird, but then she realized it was a tiny possum, peeking out from behind the trash can outside. The little creature had a playful, almost mischievous look in its eyes, and it seemed to be watching Lily with interest.
      As the days went by, Lily began to see the possum more and more often. It would come by the cafe and peek in the windows, or scamper along the rooftops, occasionally letting out a high-pitched flutter of excitement. Lily found herself becoming more and more intrigued by the little possum, and she started to leave little treats for it, like bits of croissant or leftover crumbs from her pastry.
      One day, as Lily was leaving the cafe after her shift, she heard a commotion coming from a nearby alley. She cautiously peeked around the corner and saw a group of men in dark suits, talking in hushed tones. At first, she thought it was just a group of businessmen, but then she noticed the small possum perched on a nearby trash can, watching the men with a keen interest.
      Suddenly, one of the men noticed the possum and lunged towards it, grabbing it roughly by the tail. The possum let out a high-pitched scream of terror, and Lily felt her heart skip a beat. Without thinking, she ran towards the men and demanded that they release the possum.
      The men laughed at her and told her to mind her own business, but Lily refused to back down. She managed to grab the possum from the man's grip and cradled it gently in her arms. As she looked into the possum's bright, joyful eyes, she knew that she had to protect it at all costs.

book-text-names = From a philosophical perspective, names hold a significant role in human understanding and perception of the world. The use of names and language itself is a cornerstone of human consciousness, as it allows us to create concepts and ideas that can be shared and communicated.
      In many philosophical traditions, such as in the works of Plato and Aristotle, names were seen as more than just labels for objects or individuals, but as reflections of the underlying nature of reality. According to Plato, the names we give to things are not arbitrary but reflect an underlying reality or essence of that thing. In other words, a name is not just a label, but it is a representation of the thing's essential nature.
      Moreover, names can also reflect the power dynamics of society. Some philosophers argue that names and language are used to create hierarchies and establish power relations between individuals and groups. For example, in certain cultures, the act of naming is reserved for those in positions of authority, such as parents naming their children or leaders naming places or institutions. In this way, names can be seen as a form of social control, as those with the power to name hold the authority to shape and define the world around them.
      Finally, names can also play a significant role in our understanding of our own identity and mortality. As the philosopher Martin Heidegger argued, names can be seen as a form of "thrownness," reflecting our existence as finite beings in a world that is beyond our control. In this sense, our names are not just labels, but they are a reflection of our existence and the time and place in which we find ourselves.
      In conclusion, from a philosophical perspective, names hold a significant role in human understanding and perception of the world, reflecting both our essential nature and the power dynamics of society. They are not just labels, but a reflection of our existence and our place in the world.

book-text-earth = As I sit here in my tiny cabin on the space station, I can't help but think back to my youth on Earth. It seems like a lifetime ago, and in many ways it was. I was born and raised near the ocean, and it was always a part of my life. The sound of the waves crashing against the shore, the salty smell in the air, the feeling of the sand between my toes – these are all memories that I hold dear.
      When I was in my 20s, I made the decision to leave Earth and join the space program. It was an exciting opportunity, and I was eager to explore the final frontier. For many years, I was content with my life on the space station. I enjoyed the camaraderie of my fellow astronauts, the thrill of discovery, and the sense of purpose that came with our mission.
      But as I've grown older, I've found myself yearning for the things I left behind on Earth. The ocean, in particular, is something that I miss deeply. I remember the way the sun would reflect off the water, creating a dazzling display of light and color. I remember the feel of the cool water on my skin, and the thrill of diving beneath the waves. I remember the taste of fresh seafood, caught by local fishermen and served up in the quaint seaside restaurants.
      But it's not just the ocean that I miss. I miss the feel of grass beneath my feet, the smell of flowers in the springtime, the taste of a juicy peach picked right from the tree. I miss the sound of laughter from children playing in the park, the sight of couples walking hand-in-hand along a tree-lined path. I miss the sense of community that comes with living in a small town, where everyone knows each other and looks out for one another.
      Sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice in leaving Earth. But then I remember the incredible things I've seen and done in space – the breathtaking views of distant planets, the awe-inspiring power of a supernova, the camaraderie of my fellow astronauts as we worked together to accomplish our goals. These experiences have been truly amazing, and I wouldn't trade them for anything.
      Still, there are moments when I feel a deep ache in my heart for the world I left behind. I wonder if I'll ever get to experience those simple pleasures again. I wonder if I'll ever feel the sand between my toes, or taste the salt in the air, or hear the sound of the waves crashing against the shore. But for now, all I can do is close my eyes and imagine that I'm back on Earth, surrounded by the things I miss the most.

book-text-aurora = Dear Diary,

      Today is a momentous day for the crew of the Starship Aurora. After months of floating through the vast expanse of space, they are finally landing back on Earth.

      As the ship descends through the atmosphere, the heat of reentry causes the hull to glow a fiery red, and the ship buffets against the atmosphere. It's a rough ride, but the crew is in good hands.

      Now, as they settle back into life on Earth, they know that they'll carry the memories of this journey with them forever. It has been a privilege to be a part of this crew, and they're grateful for every moment that they've shared together.

      Until next time,
      The anonymous member of the Starship Aurora crew.

book-text-temple = My dear brothers and sisters, I stand before you today to speak about the question of why there are more than one god. As a priest, I have dedicated my life to the study of the divine, and it is my firm belief that there are multiple gods because of the very nature of existence itself.
      Consider the vastness of our universe, with its countless galaxies, stars, and planets. Each one is unique, with its own set of physical laws and properties. If we accept that the universe was created by a single, all-powerful deity, then how can we explain this diversity?
      The answer lies in the realization that existence is not a simple, straightforward concept. It is complex, layered, and multifaceted, with many different dimensions and aspects. Just as there are countless different forms of matter and energy in the universe, so too are there many different forces and entities that make up the divine.
      Each god represents a different aspect of existence, whether it be love, wisdom, strength, or justice. Just as different people have different talents and abilities, so too do different gods have unique powers and roles to play in the grand scheme of things.
      But why, you may ask, does this matter to us? Why should we care about the nature of the divine? The answer is that understanding the divine is essential to our own spiritual growth and development. By recognizing the complexity and diversity of the divine, we gain a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of the world around us, and we can begin to see our own place within it.
      So let us embrace the many gods that make up the divine, and let us strive to learn from each of them. May we be blessed with the wisdom, strength, and love of the divine, and may we continue to grow and evolve in our own spiritual journeys.

book-text-watched = I don't know who "they" are, but I can feel their eyes on me. It's like a prickling sensation on the back of my neck, and it won't go away. No matter where I go or what I do, I can feel them watching me.
      It's not just my imagination, either. I've caught glimpses of shadowy figures in the corners of my vision, lurking just out of sight. I've heard footsteps echoing down the halls when I know I'm alone. And there have been times when I've felt a hand on my shoulder, only to turn around and find no one there.
      I've tried to ignore it, tried to tell myself that it's just paranoia. But the feeling is too strong, too real. I can't shake the sense that something is very wrong.
      I've started to keep a log of all the strange occurrences, but it only adds to my unease. The entries pile up day after day, documenting every instance of the feeling of being watched. It's like a never-ending nightmare that I can't wake up from.
      The worst part is not knowing who is behind it all. It could be anyone on this space station, or it could be something more sinister. I've tried to approach Joe Mendez, the Head of Security, about it, but he just brushes me off. He says there's nothing to worry about, that it's just my imagination getting the best of me.
      But I know that's not true. The feeling of being watched is too strong, too persistent. I'm starting to fear for my safety. What if "they" are planning something? What if I'm in danger?
      I don't know what to do, but I can't keep living like this. The constant surveillance is driving me to madness. I need to find out who is behind it all and put a stop to it before it's too late.

book-text-medical-officer = Dr. John Smith was a seasoned medical officer aboard the research station, SS Horizon. He had seen it all: from viral outbreaks to mechanical malfunctions, and everything in between. But nothing had prepared him for what was about to happen.

He was joined by a few crew members, including the Captain, the Chief Engineer, and the Head of Security.
      As they discussed their plan of action, a wizard suddenly appeared before them, claiming to have come from the future with a warning. The wizard warned them that their fate was sealed and that the only way to survive was to work together and trust each other. Smith was skeptical but decided to heed the wizard's advice.
      The group quickly formulated a plan: the captain would lead the defense against the nukies, the chief engineer would work on repairing the damage, and Smith would treat any injured crew members. As they worked, they discovered that there were traitors among them, working with the nukies to bring down the station.
      Smith's skills were put to the test as he tended to the wounded while also keeping an eye out for any suspicious activity. It was a delicate balance, but he managed to keep his cool, fueled by nothing but coffee and spite.
      The battle was fierce, but they managed to hold off the nukies and secure the station. In the aftermath, they uncovered the traitors, and justice was served. The wizard appeared once again, congratulating them on their survival and disappearing just as quickly.

      Rufus quickly turned around to see a petite fairy hovering in the air behind him. She had a mischievous glint in her eye and a playful smile on her face. Rufus was taken aback, as he had never seen a fairy before.
      The fairy introduced herself as Blossom and explained that she was the protector of the carrot patch. She had been watching Rufus from afar and knew he was a mischievous rabbit. However, she was feeling playful that day and decided to let him have a few carrots.
      Rufus was ecstatic and thanked Blossom for her generosity. She then offered to take him on a ride through the forest on her back, and Rufus eagerly accepted. As they soared through the trees, the breeze in Rufus's face and the sight of the whimsical forest around him made him feel like he was in a dream.
      After their ride, Blossom bid Rufus farewell and disappeared into the forest. Rufus hopped back on his bicycle, feeling grateful for the experience and the delicious carrot he had enjoyed.

      Without a moment's hesitation, Sarah took out her pen and notebook and began to write. She wrote about the beauty of the scene, the peacefulness she felt, and the surreal quality of the moment. She wanted to capture this feeling and share it with others through her words.
      As she finished writing, Sarah heard the snap of a twig and looked up to see a man approaching her with a camera. He introduced himself as a nature photographer and asked if she had seen the waterfall. They struck up a conversation, and soon they were both laughing and sharing stories of their adventures.
      As the sun began to set, the two of them packed up their gear and said their goodbyes. Sarah felt grateful for this unexpected encounter and the inspiration it brought her. She knew that this moment would stay with her forever, and she felt a sense of serenity knowing that there was still so much beauty in the world waiting to be discovered.

book-text-janitor = [bold][color=black][head=3]The Tales of a Tired Janitor[/head][/bold]
      Cleaning a space station as a janitor is like being trapped in a cosmic custodial nightmare. You'd think floating through the vastness of space would be glamorous, but no, I'm stuck scrubbing space grime and extraterrestrial goop off the walls. It's a thankless job in a zero-gravity abyss.
      First off, let's talk about the mess. Space dust, alien gunk, and who knows what else accumulates faster than a rocket launch. It's not just about sweeping up the crumbs; it's about battling interstellar filth that seems to have a life of its own. You'd hope for a sleek, futuristic space station, but you get a swirling vortex of space garbage waiting for you around every corner.
      And the tools they give us! You'd expect state-of-the-art cleaning gadgets, but nope. They raided a dollar store on Earth before launching us into the cosmos. Mops that barely work in microgravity, spray bottles that run out in one use, and don't even get me started on the space janitor jumpsuit. I feel like a reject from a sci-fi B-movie.
      Speaking of jumpsuits, the lack of respect is astronomical. The scientists and astronauts zoom past in their sleek suits, utterly oblivious to the fact that I'm the unsung hero keeping this place from turning into a cosmic trash heap. I bet they don't even know my name. "Hey, Space Janitor!" That's what I get. No appreciation for the elbow grease I put into keeping their precious station spick and span.
      And let's remember the hazards. Cleaning up alien slime? Yeah, that's a regular Tuesday for me. One wrong move and I'm dealing with an intergalactic biohazard. It's like playing Russian roulette with space critters that could burst out of some hidden nook and cranny. I signed up to mop floors, not play host to extraterrestrial invaders.
      Being a janitor on this so-called Space Station 14 is a cosmic joke. Where did the other 13 stations go? It's not all spacewalks and futuristic gadgets; it's scrubbing toilets and battling alien goo. If anyone thinks space is glamorous, they clearly haven't seen the mess we space janitors deal with every single day. It's time they appreciate the unsung heroes of the space station – the custodians of the cosmos.

book-text-escalation = When it comes to getting robusted, it's all about strategy. Do it right and you'll be the envy of the station. Do it wrong and the gods themselves may turn against you. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        First things first: let the insults fly! This is your chance to really let your opponent know what you think of their ridiculously large shoes and that annoying bike horn.

        No conflict is complete without a little bit of physicality. Give your opponent a good shove or two, and if you're lucky, they'll stumble and fall, providing even more opportunities for insults.

        But beware, because by now your opponent is probably trying to kill you. So, try to calm things down a bit. It'll make you look good during the inevitable homicide investigation.

        If deescalation doesn't work, it's time to grab a weapon. But be smart about it - choose something that looks like it couldn't possibly be deadly, like this book.

        And if you're both still standing, it's time to pull out the big guns. Find the sharpest thing you can and end things, because everyone's getting kind of tired of this by now.

        Now parade your vanquished opponent through the halls to the medbay so that everyone knows just how robust you really are.

        Remember, it's all about conserving energy. Let your opponent do some of the escalation for you - it's a win-win!

book-text-escalation-security = Get it right and you'll have the whole station calling you shitsec. Get it wrong and you'll face harmbatoning from the gods. Personally, I always aim for the former...

        They say the pen is mightier than the sword, but you don't have a sword, you have a stun baton, and as soon as you start writing, any suspect is going to leave.

        So, try starting your confrontations with words. It probably won't get you called shitsec, but it's also not likely to be very effective against someone with lethal intent.

        Your next move should be to use non-lethal or less lethal devices, like stun batons, disablers, flashes, and flashbangs. Just make sure you get some training on these before trying to use them - offering them to a suspect in exchange for their cooperation is not an effective use of these tools.

        If you're lucky enough to run into a suspect who is a lethal threat, it's time to bust out all the goodies you've been hoarding from the armory.

        For an extra intimidation factor, take your robusted suspects to the medbay to be healed instead of the brig. That way, the whole crew can see just how robust you are.

      SO JUST KEEP AT IT!!

      MY NUMBER TWO TIP. I JUST CAN'T STOP FUCKING GRINDING UP JUMPSUITS. MY "COLLEAGUES" (agents) KEEP YELLING AT ME

      CONCLUSION: IGOR CHEMISTRY

book-text-botanics = ** Applications of Botanical Specimens Found In Nanotrasen Territories **

      Many plants, when ground, yield useful chemicals. S. (spessmens) papaver and S. aloe vera
      are known for their basic healing properties.

      S. lucidum, or lingzhi, is known for its potent ability to save those near death from toxins. Eating too much
      is known to cause adverse effects.

      S. amanita, a powerfully poisonous specimen (Rest In Peace Sir Alacaster), and S. galactica, a
      seemingly ordinary antitoxin, appear to have some sort of relation to eachother.

      Some research is being done on combinations of the medicinal plants discussed, and they may prove fruitful.

      Outside, the engineerin chief got blasted by two Syndies hooked up with some fierce contraband. There wasn't enough of him for an open casket funeral.

      Things always go wild here.. I'll never look at clowns the same.

      The question is.. Who did it?

      AME controller needs LV power and an HV wire to output to. Check the area with a crowbar if you aren't sure.
      There should be an empty room next to where you found this, that room's wired for the AME.
      You can put an AME anywhere if you can get the wires to it, though.
      3x3 grid of AME parts, multitool them to unpack. Be careful not to 'trap' anything.
      AME controller adjacent horizontally or vertically (not diagonally) to any point.
      With only 1 core (what a 3x3 grid will get you), don't turn it up above 2.
      The golden rule is 2 injection for every 1 core. You can go lower to save fuel.
      Higher will burn the engine out and eventually make it explode. Don't.
      Don't forget to refuel it, it tends to stop at the worst possible time.

book-text-agrichemkit-manual = Thank you for choosing the safe-for-all-ages NanoTrasen Agri-Chem is Fun! chemistry kit, the best learning-adjacent toy of 2468! Be prepared to discover all about the biggest innovations in agriculture since people buried fish with their corn seeds.

      Contents:
      5 handily labeled 30u bottles, 1 each of nitrogen, phosphorus, hydrogen, potassium, and ethanol
      2 Safe-T-Fun(TM) sized 5u vials, 1 each of chlorine and radium
      1 30u empty bottle, ready for your experiments.

      First Experiment: EZ Nutrient
      To create EZ Nutrient, a fertilizer densely packed with nutrients required for healthy plants, mix equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. To make a full bottle, thats 10u of each.
      A little bottle of EZ Nutrient replaces a big stack of produce you'd otherwise compost to keep your plants growing strong. And crops you compost are crops you didn't make a profit on, so keep that EZ Nutrient flowing.

      Second Experiment: Ammonia and Diethylamine
      Mix 3 parts hydrogen to 1 part nitrogen to make ammonia. It's a healthy, nutritious treat for your crops that aren't at their best.
      But if you want to impress the judges at your local NanoTrasen-sponsored County Fair, you'll need to add an equal amount of ethanol to your ammonia.
      This will mix into Diethylamine, a miracle fertilizer that can make plants grow faster AND live longer! Keep the crops you love with you longer thanks to Diethylamine.

      Third Experiment: Unstable Mutagen
      When you're ready to show everyone you're the greatest botanist on the station, you'll need to mix up some unstable mutagen and hope for the best. Despite the scary name, unstable mutagen is entirely safe when applied to plants, but do not drink the appealingly green chemical yourself.

      Mix equal parts radium, phosphorus, and chlorine together to get a bright green batch of unstable mutagen, the safe and fun way to get the most of your farm. The 15u this kit lets you make could be your introduction to agrichemical stardom!
      Unstable mutagen can have a wide variety of effects on plant life, including drastic changes to all sorts of growth parameters, produce full of helpful pharmaceuticals, plants that glow in the dark, or creating entirely new species.

      Each individual plant responds to unstable mutagen differently, so you may want to use small doses on multiple crops and try to crossbreed the best traits from each of those. Applying multiple doses to one plant can stack multiple changes and make it harder to single out desirable traits.
      Unstable mutagen is entirely safe when used as a fertilizer, and NanoTrasen takes no responsibility for dead crops, excessive water bills, newly sentient plants asking existential questions, or flora-strangled farmhands that may coincidentally occur while using it.
      Do not drink unstable mutagen. Wash your hands thoroughly after handing. Wash your eyes if you have looked at unstable mutagen for over 30 minutes in a 24 hour period. Store in a dark room between 293–295K. Do not use on corporate holidays. If you begin hearing voices telling you to drink unstable mutagen, please contact your doctor, head of personnel, or exorcist.
